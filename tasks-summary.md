## Parallel Opportunities Identified
- Setup tasks can run in parallel
- Foundational tasks have 4 parallelizable tasks
- Each user story has multiple parallelizable components
- Test tasks can be developed in parallel with implementation

## Independent Test Criteria
- **User Story 1**: The chat interface can accept natural language commands and correctly translate them into todo operations
- **User Story 2**: The web UI allows users to perform all basic todo operations through button clicks and form inputs
- **User Story 3**: Administrators can use kubectl-ai and kagent to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize the system

## Format Validation
- All tasks follow the required checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
- Each task includes specific file paths for implementation
- User story tasks are properly labeled with [US1], [US2], [US3] tags
- Parallelizable tasks are marked with [P] tags
